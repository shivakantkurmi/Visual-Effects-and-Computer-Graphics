# Motion Tracking with Matchmover Using Blender

This project demonstrates motion tracking using Blender to match 3D objects with live-action footage. The workflow focuses on tracking camera motion and applying it to Blender’s 3D environment.

## Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Video Clip
- Choose a video clip with clear, high-contrast features for tracking.

---

### Step 2: Set Up Blender for Motion Tracking
1. **Open Blender**: Switch to the **Motion Tracking** workspace from the top bar.
2. **Load the Video**:
   - Open the **Movie Clip Editor** → Click **Open** → Load your video file.

---

### Step 3: Track Features in the Video
1. **Set Up Markers**:
   - Click **Detect Features** to automatically place tracking markers, or manually place markers by holding **Ctrl + Click** on distinct points.
2. **Track Motion**:
   - Click **Track Forward (▶)** to track each marker through the frames.
   - Adjust marker settings (like search size) if tracking fails.

---

### Step 4: Solve the Camera Motion
1. **Set Up Keyframes**:
   - Go to the **Solve** tab in the sidebar and set two keyframes where camera motion is distinct.
2. **Solve Camera Motion**:
   - Click **Solve Camera Motion** and check the **Solve Error** (should be under 1 pixel for accuracy).
3. **Refine Tracking**:
   - If needed, clean up bad tracks by selecting them (**Ctrl + L**) and deleting failed markers.

---

### Step 5: Set Up the 3D Scene
1. **Set Up Scene**:
   - Click **Set Up Tracking Scene** in the Solve tab. Blender will add a camera and a basic plane.
2. **Adjust Scale**:
   - Go to the 3D viewport and adjust the scene scale by aligning 3D objects with tracked markers.

---

### Step 6: Render the Scene
1. **Enable Background Video**:
   - In **Render Properties**, enable the background video to appear during rendering.
2. **Render the Animation**:
   - Render the scene as an animation (**Render > Render Animation**).

---

### Step 7: Improve Tracking (If Needed)
- If motion tracking is not accurate:
  - Go back to **Detect Features**.
  - Use a **closer threshold and distance** to detect more reliable markers.
  - Repeat **Steps 3–6** to refine the tracking and improve accuracy.

---

## Tips & Best Practices
- Use footage with **good lighting and high-contrast features**.
- Ensure at least **8–10 tracking points** for accurate camera solving.
- Clean up any **drifting or failed markers** before solving camera motion.
